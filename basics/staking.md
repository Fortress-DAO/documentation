# Staking

## What is Staking

**Staking is the primary value accrual strategy of Fortress.** Stakers stake their FORT on [the Fortress website](https://app.fortressdao.finance/#/) to earn rebase rewards. The rebase rewards come from the proceed from bond sales, and can vary based on the number of FORT staked in the protocol and the reward rate set by monetary policy.

**Staking is a passive, long-term strategy.** The increase in your stake of FORT translates into a constantly falling cost basis converging on zero. This means even if the market price of FORT drops below your initial purchase price, given a long enough staking period, the increase in your staked FORT balance should eventually outpace the fall in price.

**When you stake, you lock FORT and receive an equal amount of sFORT.** Your sFORT balance rebases up automatically at the end of every epoch. sFORT is transferable and therefore composable with other DeFi protocols.

**When you unstake, you burn sFORT and receive an equal amount of FORT.** Unstaking means the user will forfeit the upcoming rebase reward. Note that the forfeited reward is only applicable to the unstaked amount; the remaining staked FORT (if any) will continue to receive rebase rewards.
