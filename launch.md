# Launch



Fortress launched on 18th November, 2021, 18:00 UTC.&#x20;

We chose to launch on Avalanche, which is consistent with our goals of democratisation and community access. Avalanche provides the following advantages to our community:

* **Speed:** The Avalanche chain is blazingly fast. Transactions are processed and settled in seconds.
* **Affordability:** Transaction fees on Avalanche are extremely low cost, generally around 25‚Äì40 cents per transaction.
* **Accessibility:** There are numerous options to bridge funds to Avalanche, including trusted dApps such as Synapse, AnySwap, and cBRIDGE.
* **Eco-friendly:** Avalanche, which is built around PoS, consumes much less electricity than traditional PoW chains. Fortress knows full well that ‚Äúhealth is wealth‚Äù ‚Äî thus we are committed to ensuring a brighter, greener, and wealthier future for all.

## Liquidity Bootstrap Event

Our liquidity bootstrap event (LBE) was held on November 14, 2021 at 5:00 PM GMT, and raised $350,000 at a valuation of $5 per $FORT. The LBE was conducted using the stablecoin MIM on Avalanche. Initially, our plan was to split the LBE into two parts: a whitelist, and a public sale.

We selected 300 whitelisted users who had access to the LBE for a 24-hour period. Note: because the maximum amount of funds raised through whitelisted users was $300,000, every whitelisted LBE participant was guaranteed to be able to contribute up to their $1,000 limit.

To get whitelisted, users had to secure a spot by completing various tasks:

* All members had to incorporate \[üè∞,üè∞] into their server profile name in order to be eligible for a whitelist spot.
* 100 WLs were awarded to those intrepid few, the first 100 entrants of the Fortress Discord.
* 50 WLs were awarded to members who boosted the Fortress server and remained engaged and active in the community.
* 50 WLs were awarded in a [Twitter contest](https://twitter.com/FortressDAO/status/1458083294327840784).
* 50 WLs were awarded to those with the most invites and referrals of real community members.
* 50 WLs were awarded to members who provided extraordinary service to our community. This service came in the form of regional language community mods, translation services, outstanding memes and GIFs that spark joy, or whatever the community needed to grow and thrive.

After the 24-hour whitelisted LBE closed, the LBE opened access to the public to fill in the remainder of the $350,000. Public LBE access was limited to a maximum contribution of $500 per wallet.&#x20;

However, Fortress grew at a rate we personally did not expect. This resulted in the public sale selling out in just 1 second, with the majority of tokens ending up in botters's hands. As we believe in fair distribution, and did not want botters to have such a big allocation as not to ruin the project, we decided to let each person participating in the public sale only keep a maximum of 200 FORT - same allocation as people participating in the whitelisted round. The remaining MIM that was paid for others FORT tokens were refunded. This meant that more spots opened up, so we decided to just whitelist more people through a raffle.

From the 350,000 MIM we raised by in the Liquidity Bootstrap Event:

* 160,000 MIM was paired with 21,333 FORT in the liquidity pool on TraderJoe, at a rate of 1 $FORT = 7.5 $MIM. The LP tokens are permanently saved inside the Fortress‚Äôs treasury.
* 70,000 MIM was transferred to the treasury, securing the value of the protocol.
* 120,000 MIM was allocated to our development team for daily operational costs and continued development.
