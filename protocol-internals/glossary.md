## APR <a href="#apr" id="apr"></a>

Annual Percentage Rate, is the annualised interest rate without taking the effect of compounding into account.

## APY <a href="#apy" id="apy"></a>

Annual Percentage Yield, is the normalised representation of an interest rate, based on a compounding period over one year. Note that APYs provided are rather ballpark level indicators and not so much precise future results.

## BCV <a href="#bcv" id="bcv"></a>

Bond Control Variable, is the scaling factor at which bond prices change. A higher BCV means a lower discount for bonders and higher inflation by the protocol. A lower BCV means a higher discount for bonders and lower inflation by the protocol.

## DAO <a href="#dao" id="dao"></a>

Decentralized Autonomous Organization, is a governance mechanism for making decisions in a more trustless and collaborative way. Voting rights are often bound to a governance token. In Fortress the governance token is sFORT.

## DCV <a href="#dcv" id="dcv"></a>

Deflation Control Variable, is the scaling factor at which protocol defined buy pressure changes. A higher DCV means more buy pressure from the protocol, resulting in a higher deflation. A lower DCV means less buy pressure from the protocol, resulting in a lower deflation.

## EVM <a href="#evm" id="evm"></a>

Ethereum Virtual Machine, is a state machine in which all Ethereum accounts and smart contracts live. At any given block in the chain, Avalanche has one and only one canonical state, and the EVM is what defines the rules for computing a new valid state from block to block.

## Liquidity Bonds <a href="#liquidity-bonds" id="liquidity-bonds"></a>

Liquidity bonds are LP token bonds. Examples are FORT-MIM LP bonds.

## PCV <a href="#pcv" id="pcv"></a>

Protocol Controlled Value, is the amount of funds the treasury owns and controls. The more PCV the better for the protocol and its users.

## POL <a href="#pol" id="pol"></a>

Protocol Owned Liquidity, is the amount of LP the treasury owns and controls. The more POL the better for the protocol and its users.

## PoR <a href="#por" id="por"></a>

Proof of Reserve, is the mechanism of strengthening the reserve of Fortress treasury via the sales of bonds. Bonders provide liquidity to the treasury, thereby building its reserve. In return for their service, bonders get paid in FORT.

## Reserve Bonds <a href="#reserve-bonds" id="reserve-bonds"></a>

Reserve bonds are single asset bonds. They are sometimes referred to as "naked" bonds. Examples are DAI bonds.

## Reward Rate <a href="#reward-rate" id="reward-rate"></a>

Reward rate is the configured percentage of FORT distributed to all stakers on each rebase relative to the total supply. The reward rate is precisely set by the policy team.

## Reward Yield <a href="#reward-yield" id="reward-yield"></a>

Reward yield refers to the actual amount of FORT received by each staker on each rebase. The reward yield is a rough target from a policy point of view. It can almost never be maintained precisely due to e.g. fluctuating amounts of FORT staked.

## Backing per FORT <a href="#backing-per-fhm" id="backing-per-fhm"></a>

_Backing per FORT_, is the amount of funds the treasury guarantees to use for backing **FORT**.

## RFV <a href="#rfv" id="rfv"></a>

Risk Free Value, is the amount of funds the treasury guarantees to use for backing FORT.

## LP <a href="#lp" id="lp"></a>

Liquidity Provider, is the token received when providing liquidity on SpookySwap. For instance LP bonds require LP tokens of the FORT / MIM pair.

## TVL <a href="#tvl" id="tvl"></a>

Total Value Locked, is the dollar amount of all FORT staked in the protocol. This metric is often used as growth or health indicator in DeFi projects.

## TaaS <a href="#taas" id="taas"></a>

Treasury as a Service, is the business model of decentralized custody of partnership funds. Fortress is designed for TaaS by selling bonds and absorbing partners' liquidity into its treasury as a result.

## TWAP <a href="#twap" id="twap"></a>

Time Weighted Average Price, is the average price of an asset over a specified time. TWAPs are used to represent the fair value of an asset as defined by the market.
