# Token Structure

## Distribution

FORT started with a supply of 101,000 FORT. There is no maximum supply, as the amount of tokens grows as people mint & stake.

### Liquidity Bootstrap event (70,000 FORT)

60,000 FORT was sold to people with "Knight" role on our [discord](https://discord.gg/fortress) for a price of 5 MIM per FORT, with a maximum allocation of 1000 MIM per person.

10,000 FORT was sold to people who won in our raffle. These people could buy FORT for the same price as Knights (5 MIM per FORT), but had a smaller maximum allocation of 500 MIM.

### Initial Liquidity (21,333 FORT)

These FORT tokens were paired with 160,000 MIM to add initial liquidity on TraderJoe. We chose TraderJoe as it is the most used decentralised exchange on Avalanche.

### Development Team (10,000 FORT)

The leading team (also known as Arce Deum) has 10,000 **unstaked** FORT vested over the next 6 months to support development. It might seem like a lot % wise from launch, but these tokens got massively diluted because of not being staked.&#x20;
