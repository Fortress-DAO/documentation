# Buying FORT



{% hint style="warning" %}
You can currently only buy FORT on [TraderJoe](https://traderjoexyz.com/#/trade?inputCurrency=0x130966628846BFd36ff31a822705796e8cb8C18D\&outputCurrency=0xf6d46849DB378AE01D93732585BEc2C4480D1fD5) or DEX aggregators such as [matcha](https://matcha.xyz) and [ParaSwap](https://paraswap.io/#/?network=avalanche). Make sure to **check the slippage first** before buying FORT, as some venue offers worse rate than the others due to low liquidity.
{% endhint %}

1\. Go to this [TraderJoe swap page](https://traderjoexyz.com/#/trade?inputCurrency=0x130966628846BFd36ff31a822705796e8cb8C18D\&outputCurrency=0xf6d46849DB378AE01D93732585BEc2C4480D1fD5). We use TraderJoe as an example here. It is recommended to compare the exchange rate across different DEXes to ensure you are getting the best price.

2\. Make sure the output currency is FORT. You can also copy and paste the FORT contract address (0xf6d46849db378ae01d93732585bec2c4480d1fd5) into the output currency field to ensure you are swapping for the right token.

3\. You can select any input currency based on your available wallet balance. It is recommended to use MIM as the input currency to minimise the slippage.

4\. Select the amount of FORT you want to swap for. Then click "Approve" and sign the transaction.

5\. After the "Approve" transaction has been processed successfully, click "Swap" and sign the transaction.

6\. You should see FORT in your wallet balance now after the swap transaction is successful. If you cannot find it in your wallet, add FORT's contract address (0xf6d46849db378ae01d93732585bec2c4480d1fd5) to your wallet.

{% hint style="info" %}
The "Approve" transaction is only needed when you swap FORT for the first time; subsequent swapping only requires you to perform the "Swap" transaction.
