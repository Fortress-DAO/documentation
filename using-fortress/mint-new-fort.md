# Minting FORT〖⚔️ ,⚔️〗

Minting allow users to mint FORT from the protocol at a discount by trading it with 1) liquidity (LP tokens) or 2) other assets. The former is called liquidity bonds and the latter reserve bonds.

Minting takes roughly 15 epochs to vest, and FORT tokens are vested linearly to the user over that period. Liquidity bonds help the protocol to accumulate and lock liquidity, while reserve bonds allow the protocol to grow its treasury, and thus its RFV faster.

Fortress offers various types of bonds on its website:

* FORT/MIM LP bond
* sFUSD bond
* wAVAX bond
* MIM bond

## Sending your rewards to another wallet

You can bond while sending the minted FORT to another address. This is useful for additional privacy, or for doing multiple mints while the current bonds are still vesting. Note that if the same account holds multiple bonds, the rewards you can claim from the earlier bonds have to be forfeited, so make sure to claim your rewards before minting again. Rewards that were not given to you just yet will not be lost - they will be added to the bond and given to you over a 5 day period.&#x20;

3.) The menu will show up. At the Recipient Address field, you can specify a different address that will receive the vested FORT. By default, it is filled with your current address.

4.) You can also modify the Slippage field to increase or decrease the likelihood of your order getting through. A higher slippage increases that likelihood, but you may get a more undesirable fill price.

5.) Close the menu by clicking the cogwheel icon again.

6.) Click "Approve" and sign the transaction.

7.) After the "Approve" transaction has been processed successfully, click "Mint" and sign the transaction. Voila, you have successfully minted FORT!

_Notes:_

* _The "Approve" transaction is only needed when minting for the first time; subsequent minting only requires you to perform the "Mint" transaction._
* _Do not alter the bond amount after you have closed the menu, as it will reset the recipient address._
