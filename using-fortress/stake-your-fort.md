# Staking FORT„Äñüè∞, üè∞„Äó

Staking allows you to earn FORT passively via auto-compounding. By staking your FORT with Fortress, you receive sFORT (staked FORT) in return at a 1:1 ratio. After that, your sFORT balance will increase automatically on every epoch based on the current APY.

### How to stake FORT

* Go to the [Stake page of Fortress's website.](https://app.fortressdao.finance/#/stake) Select the "Stake" tab.
* Enter the amount of FORT that you would like to stake in the input field. If you would like to stake all your FORT, press the "Max" button and the input field will be populated with all your available FORT balance.
* Click "Approve" and sign the transaction.
* After the "Approve" transaction has been processed successfully, click "Stake" and sign the transaction. Voila, you have staked your FORT!

## How to Unstake

1. Go to the [Stake page of Fortress's website. ](https://app.fortressdao.finance/#/stake)Select the "Unstake" tab.
2. Enter the amount of sFORT that you would like to unstake in the input field. If you would like to unstake all your sFORT, press the "Max" button and the input field will be populated with all your available sFORT balance.
3. Click "Approve" and sign the transaction.
4. After the "Approve" transaction has been processed successfully, click "Unstake" and sign the transaction.

_Note: The "Approve" transaction is only needed when staking/unstaking for the first time; subsequent staking/unstaking only requires you to perform the "Stake" or "Unstake" transaction._

## Reading the Info

**APY** tells you the annualized rate of return based on the reward yield. It takes into account the effect of compounding since s_FORT_ rebases exponentially.

**TVL** measures the dollar amount of all the staked FORT in Fortress.

**Current Index** allows you to track your gain from staking. The index started from 1 at epoch 0, and increases every epoch. If you staked at genesis (epoch 0) and never unstaked any FORT, your balance today would be X times greater, where X is the current index. You can use the index to track your position by marking down the index number when you stake and unstake. You divide the index number when you unstake by the index number when you stake to get the ratio by which your sFORT balance has increased.

**Your Balance** tells you how many unstaked FORT are in your wallet. This is the maximum amount that you can stake.

**Your Staked Balance** tells you how many staked FORT are in your wallet. This is the maximum amount that you can unstake.

**Next Rebase** tells you the remaining time until the next rebase.

**Reward Yield** tells you how much your sFORT balance will increase when the next epoch begins. For example, if you stake 100 FORT and the upcoming rebase is 0.5427%, your sFORT balance would increase from 100 to 100.5427.

**ROI (5-Day Rate)** estimates how much your sFORT balance will increase after 5 days, if the reward yield stays the same during this period. For example, if you stake 100 FORT and the rate is 8.4577%, your sFORT balance would increase from 100 to 108.4577 after 5 days.
