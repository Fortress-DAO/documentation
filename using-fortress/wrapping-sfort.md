# Wrapping sFORT

{% hint style="warning" %}
wsFORT is the wrapped version of staked FORT (sFORT)!&#x20;
{% endhint %}

**sFORT increases in amount over time, while wsFORT increases in price.**&#x20;

You can track wsFORT's price on the dashboard. The amount of wsFORT in your wallet does not change over time, so an easy method to calculate your holdings is to multiply the price of wsFORT on the dashboard by the amount of wsFORT in your wallet.

When you unwrap your wsFORT tokens, you get back your original sFORT plus any other sFORT gained due to rebasing**.** This means that you do not miss out on any of the rebases when you're wrapped.

## Wrapping

First of all, click on the "Wrap" button in the top right corner of the Dashboard.

You will have to do a one-time approval for spending sFORT. Once that is confirmed, the "Approve" button will be replaced by a "Wrap" button and you can turn your sFORT into wsFORT with a conversion rate that can be seen on the top right.

**Once you have wsFORT in your wallet, you can use them as collateral on partner platforms such as North Pole. In the future, we will also add a possibility for you to bridge wsFORT over to other chains.**&#x20;
